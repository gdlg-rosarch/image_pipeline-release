%description
Contains a node that rotates an image stream in a way that minimizes the angle
between a vector in some arbitrary frame and a vector in the camera frame. The
frame of the outgoing image is published by the node. This node is intended to
allow camera images to be visualized in an orientation that is more intuitive
than the hardware-constrained orientation of the physical camera. This is
particularly helpful, for example, to show images from the PR2's forearm cameras
with a consistent up direction, despite the fact that the forearms need to
rotate in arbitrary ways during manipulation. It is not recommended to use the
output from this node for further computation, as it interpolates the source
image, introduces black borders, and does not output a camera_info.
