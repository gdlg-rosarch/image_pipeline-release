  * remove camera_hammer and install Python nodes properly
    camera_hammer was just a test for camera info, nothing to do with
    calibration. Plus the test was basic.
  * Correct three errors that prevented the node to work properly.

    This fully fixes #85 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/85>
  * fix bad call to save an image
  * have display be in its own thread
    that could be a fix for #85 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/85>
  * fix bad usage of Numpy
    fixes #89 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/89>

  * fix typo that leads to segfault
    fixes #84 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/84>
  * also print self.report() on calibrate ... allows to use the params without having to commit them (e.g. for extrensic calibration between to cameras not used as stereo pair)
  * fixes #76 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/76>
    Move Python approximate time synchronizer to ros_comm
  * remove all trace of cv in Python (use cv2)
  * remove deprecated file (as mentioned in its help)
  * fixes #25 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/25>
    This is just removing deprecated options that were around since diamondback
  * fixes #74 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/74>
    calibrator.py is now using the cv2 only API when using cv_bridge.
    The API got changed too but it seems to only be used internally.
